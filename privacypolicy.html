    <h1>Music Map – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 13, 2025</p>
    <p>Music Map values your privacy. This policy explains what data the app collects and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collected</h2>
    <p>Music Map collects information <strong>only on your device</strong> in two ways:</p>
    
    <h3>A. When You Manually Log Songs</h3>
    <p>When you press the "Log" button, the following data is stored locally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Song Information:</strong> title, artist, album artwork (if available), date, and time</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> where you pressed the Log button</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. When You Use Cafe Mode (Song Discovery)</h3>
    <p>Cafe Mode uses Apple's ShazamKit technology to identify songs playing around you. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio Analysis:</strong> Your device's microphone captures ambient audio, which is analyzed <em>on your device only</em></li>
        <li><strong>Audio Fingerprinting:</strong> ShazamKit creates an irreversible "audio fingerprint" (a unique signature that cannot be converted back to audio)</li>
        <li><strong>Song Matching:</strong> Only this fingerprint is sent to Apple's servers to identify the song</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Once identified, the song information (title, artist, album artwork) is saved locally on your device along with your location</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Music Map never records, stores, or transmits actual audio. The audio fingerprint sent to Apple cannot be reversed to reconstruct the original sound. Your device only analyzes audio while Cafe Mode is actively running, and you control when it's on or off.
    </div>

    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal identifiers such as your name, email, or device ID.</p>

    <h2>2. How Data is Used</h2>
    <p>All collected data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. It is used only to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View your listening history</li>
        <li>Explore logs on the map with album artwork</li>
        <li>Sort songs by time or distance from your current location</li>
        <li>Replay songs to relive your memories</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your music logs are <strong>not sent to any servers or third parties</strong> (except for the audio fingerprint sent to Apple's servers during Cafe Mode song recognition, as described above).</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services: ShazamKit by Apple</h2>
    <p>When you use Cafe Mode, Music Map uses Apple's ShazamKit framework to identify songs. According to Apple's privacy policy for ShazamKit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Audio fingerprints are sent to Apple's servers for song matching</li>
        <li>Requests are associated with a random, device-generated identifier (not linked to your Apple Account by default)</li>
        <li>Apple may collect your IP address to detect fraud or misuse</li>
        <li>If you optionally enable location for song recognition, that information may be sent to Apple</li>
        <li>Apple may use deidentified and aggregate information (such as which songs are being identified and approximate locations) to improve services and share with music industry partners</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For complete details on how Apple handles ShazamKit data, please visit: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/music-recognition/">Apple's Shazam Music Recognition Privacy Policy</a></p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location (When In Use):</strong> Used when logging a song or using Cafe Mode to discover nearby music</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used only when Cafe Mode is active to identify songs playing around you. Audio is analyzed on-device and never recorded or stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Music Library Access (optional):</strong> Used to read currently playing songs and access album artwork</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permissions are optional. Some features may be limited if denied.</p>

    <h2>5. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Music Map does <strong>not</strong> use analytics, advertising, or any tracking services beyond Apple's ShazamKit for song recognition. We do not collect, analyze, or share any of your personal information.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Music Map does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app is safe for users of all ages. Parents should be aware that if a child uses Cafe Mode, audio fingerprints will be sent to Apple's servers for song identification as described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deleting the app removes all locally stored data from your device</li>
        <li>Permissions can be revoked at any time in your device settings</li>
        <li>You can turn Cafe Mode on or off at any time within the app</li>
        <li>Data sent to Apple during song recognition is governed by Apple's privacy policy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because your music logs never leave your device (except for audio fingerprints during Cafe Mode), you have full control over your information.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally using iOS's secure UserDefaults system. Because data is not transmitted to external servers (except audio fingerprints to Apple during Cafe Mode), the security of your data relies on your device's security features.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the app's features or legal requirements. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:admin@yacchi.com">admin@yacchi.com</a></p>
